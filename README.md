   Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini

## Class Summary `Chapter - 04 Talk is cheap, show me in code` (07/01/2023)
  Chapter-04 was an interesting session where we started to develop a config-driven UI for food ordering platform. First, we created LLD of the web application, continued working on creating layouts, components and data manipulation from mock data. Concepts of props(properties), virtual DOM, importance of unique key were discussed. 


One line about this chapter : `Props (properties) passed in Component are similar to the arguments passed in a js function call and received by the function definition as parameters.`

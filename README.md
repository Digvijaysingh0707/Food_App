# `Learn React With Harshi üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Series`
   Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini

## Class Summary `Chapter - 04 Talk is cheap, show me in code` (07/01/2023)
  Chapter-04 was an interesting session where we started to develop a config-driven UI for food ordering platform. First, we created LLD of the web application, continued working on creating layouts, components and data manipulation from mock data. Concepts of props(properties), virtual DOM, importance of unique key were discussed. 
  
  I have shared the steps to think in React and develop an application in `coding-assignment.md`. Using this knowledge, I have created a food ordering app named `InstaFood` this chapter. This chapter is the basic step and lots of enhancements needs to be done in the upcoming chapters. 


One line about this chapter : `Props (properties) passed in Component are similar to the arguments passed in a js function call and received by the function definition as parameters.`


Check out [Chapter-04 Live](https://learn-react-with-harshi-chapter-04.netlify.app/) for the live demo of this chapter's coding assignment (InstaFood Version 0). Also check out the following chapters to see how InstaFood has progressed. Happy Reacting !!!
